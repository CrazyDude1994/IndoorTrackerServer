# IndoorTrackerServer

This is web application (backend + frontend) for my diploma project IndoorTracker. It is using Django web app framework. However you should not consider to copy the style i'm using in this project, because it's not great. I'm doing this because I need fast prototype and I don't have time to make better architecture or use advance Django techniques (CBV, local urls, etc)
